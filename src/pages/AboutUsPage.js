          <b>A different kind of Cardano Stake Pool Explorer</b>
          <br /><br />

PoolPeek.com is a Cardano stake pool explorer that analyzes the publicly available registration data and other data
elements such as number of produced blocks and active stake. Delegators can use our powerful query features to narrow down lists of
pools and then drill deeper using our external links feature. Stake pool operators can use PoolPeek.com to keep an
eye on their competition. We offer a range or filters on ticker, name, description, blocks, margin, pledge, cost and active stake.
<br /><br />

PoolPeek.com was created by small stake pool owners who believe all pools should have a fighting chance.
A random sort order is default for most lists at PoolPeek.com. The idea is that all pools get a random chance to be at
the top of the list. An exception to this is the 'ticker' sort. Tickers sort alphabetically as you type.
There are many great small pools out there that don't get a chance to showcase their pool because of some silly ranking algorithm.
As we move forward we plan to write tools that will help small pools advertise.
<br /><br />

          <b>Pool Search</b>
          <br /><br />

Pool Search randomly displays all pools in our system that are not retiring or retired.
The order of the pools is updated daily with small pools taking priority. New pools added throughout the day will 
be placed at the top of the list. After the pools display you can page through the results and refine the query using the basic or advanced filters and sorting.
<br /><br />

<b>Map Search</b>
<br /><br />

Map Search displays active stake pools on a map. The coordinates of a pool is based on the pool's extented meta data 'location' field.
If our geo service finds exactly one match for the pool's location, we count it as a hit and display it on the map. 
You can then click the marker to drill down and see all pools at that location.
<br /><br />


          <b>Pool Queries</b>
          <br /><br />

Our text based pool queries look for keywords in the pool's data, the search is not exact and user is left to decide if
the pool meets the actual criteria. This gives us the flexibility to filter pools in ways other sites can't.
If you believe a pool is missing from one of our Pool Queries or you have an idea for a new Pool Query, please contact us.
<br /><br />


          <b>Fabulous 500</b>
          <br /><br />

500 random small pools with less than 100 blocks and less than 10 million in active stake.
Click the navigation option again to pull a different set of 500 random pools.
We support the true decentralization of the Cardano network and believe small pools are a vital part of it.
Fabulous 500 allow you to display pools in a fun random way by ticker, name or description.
Just an interesting way for a potential delegator to maybe see something of interest and
then click the pools website link or pool.pm link to find out more.
<br /><br />


          <a href="https://adafolio.com/" target="_blank"><b>adafolio.com</b></a> <b>Porfolios</b>
          <br /><br />

adafolio.com is proudly made for the Cardano Community by the team at Viper Staking!<br />
We worked with the Viper team to integrate adafolio.com portfolios into PoolPeek.com.<br />
The list of portfolios and pools display in a random order and allow you browse and research the pools
just as you would using any other PoolPeek.com query.<br />
 Further the decentralization of Cardano by spreading out your delegation to multiple stake pools.
<br /><br />

<b>Delistment of Pools via SMASH</b>
<br /><br />

Badly behaved stake pools can be delisted from display in Daedalus. Factors taken into account for such decisions 
include illegal or malicious metadata content, impersonation, the use of ticker names that were previously 
registered on the Incentivized Testnet (when this is not the same stake pool/operator), 
intellectual property rights violations, or stake pools that are no longer active. 
If a pool is delisted in Daedalus we also delist it in Pool Peek.
