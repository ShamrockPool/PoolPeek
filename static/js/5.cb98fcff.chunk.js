A random sort order is default for most lists at PoolPeek.com. The idea is that all pools get a random chance to be at the top of the list. An exception to this is the 'ticker' sort. Tickers sort alphabetically as you type. Tickers are meant to be unique and so it would make no sense to order them randomly. There are many great small pools out there that don't get a chance to showcase their pool because of some silly ranking algorithm.
