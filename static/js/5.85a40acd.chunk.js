Delegators can use our powerful query features to narrow down lists of pools and then drill deeper on specific pools using our external links feature.

The default sort on most lists at PoolPeek.com is random. The idea is that a pool or group gets a random chance to be at the top of a list. There are many great small pools out there that don't get a chance to showcase their pool because of some silly ranking algorithm. The one exception to this is the 'ticker' sort.
